## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need a GIT client. Personal preferance is TortioseGIT.
A copy can be found at https://tortoisegit.org/download/

You will need an IDE or something similar. Personal preference is Android Studio as it comes with most of the prerequisites.
A copy of Android Studio can be found at https://developer.android.com/studio/.

### Installing

Instructions on how to install TortioseGIT can be found at https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-intro-install.html. 

Instructions on how to install Android Studio can be found at https://developer.android.com/studio/install.

Once you downloaded and installed the prerequisites (the git client and IDE) ensure you have an active internet connection so that we can clone or download the source code.
